Some little things to do stuff with your personal loans history from Helsinki Metropolitan area consortia of public libraries (http://www.helmet.fi).

Go to your personal account on the HelMet -website, find the "lainaushistoria" -link, click it, and save the loaded list to a file as plain HTML.

HelMet -libraries use Innovative Millenium, and newer and the legacy OPACs are both online. User's account, and the xrecords are both served by the legacy interface.
